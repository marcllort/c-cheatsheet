// STRUCTURE: First always do the includes necessaries for your program
// USE: Always add the #include X   The X, can be different, depending of the library you are importing
// If the library is one included in C (already coded) like "strings.h" you will use <> --> #include <strings.h>
// If the library has been coded by you, like "test.h" you will use "" --> #include "test.h"
#include <stdio.h>  // stdio.h --> Always present. It has the functions of printf, scanf... all the basics.
#include <strings.h> // strings.h --> Must be used when we need functions like strlen, strok... In general string related functions
#include <math.h>   // math.h --> Used for advanced operations, like rounding numbers, sqrt (raiz cuadrada)

// STRUCTURE: Second you have to do the define of the macros/constants of your project. All those variables, that don't need
// to be changed during the execution of the program, in general, can be defined as a macro.
// USE: Always start with #define, then the name of the constant (MAX.../MIN...) and lastly the value. It can be a int,
// a char, a string... whatever you want. Remember to always write it on capital letters, and separated by underscore.
#define MAX_CHAR 100
#define MAX_PASSENGERS 5
#define PI 3.14
#define MY_NAME "John"
#define MY_SURNAME "Doe"

// STRUCTURE: Third is the global variables. This variables are available to use in all this file. It is not a good practice to use
// them, as different functions can modify it, it can end up generating errors. It is better to use local variables, which
// are the ones created inside procedures and functions, and then return them (like when a function returns an int).
int globalVariableInt = 2;

// STRUCTURE: The last thing before starting to declare functions, is to define your structs. The struct is like creating your own int,
// creating your own type. This type will be composed of other variables.

// This struct is used later in the Car struct, but to be used it must be declared before the car struct.
// It contains information about the passenger: passengerName (a string, of maximum 100 chars) and the passengerAge (an int)
struct CarPassenger {
    char passengerName[MAX_CHAR];
    int passengerAge;

// This struct represents a Car, that contains the amount of passengers currently in the car (int numberPassengers)

// Is an array of struct CarPassenger, which has been declared earlier.
