// STRUCTURE: First always do the includes necessaries for your program
// USE: Always add the #include X   The X, can be different, depending of the library you are importing
// If the library is one included in C (already coded) like "strings.h" you will use <> --> #include <strings.h>
// If the library has been coded by you, like "test.h" you will use "" --> #include "test.h"
#include <stdio.h>  // stdio.h --> Always present. It has the functions of printf, scanf... all the basics.

// STRUCTURE: Second you have to do the define of the macros/constants of your project. All those variables, that don't need
// to be changed during the execution of the program, in general, can be defined as a macro.
// USE: Always start with #define, then the name of the constant (MAX.../MIN...) and lastly the value. It can be a int,
// a char, a string... whatever you want. Remember to always write it on capital letters, and separated by underscore.
#define MAX_CHAR 100
#define PI 3.14
#define MY_NAME "John"
#define MY_SURNAME "Doe"
