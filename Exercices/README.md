# Exercices

The program, must be a menu that allows me to choose between 3 exercises. 
If a wrong option is selected, show an error and allow the user to try again.

It should look something like this: 
```
Select exercice to run:
    1. Exercise 1
    2. Exercise 2
    3. Exercise 3
```

## Exercise 1
The user will insert a string (that can contain spaces) of his name and both surnames (separated by spaces). The program must return some information about this string:
    
1. The length of the string introduced.
2. The name, and surname 1 and 2 printed in different printfs (separate the string). They must be saved in a struct User, which will contain the fields: name, surname1 and surname2.
3. The introduced string reversed.
4. Modify the introduced string, by changing where the string ends. Instead of ending after the second surname, make it end after the first surname and print it.

Example:
```
Original string: John Doe One
1. The lenght of the string is 12.
2. Name: John   Surname 1: Doe  Surname2: One
3. John Doe One --> enO eoD nhoJ
4. John Doe One --> John Doe
```
